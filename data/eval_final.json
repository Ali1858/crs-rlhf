This allows you to request external resources via chat messages. For example: if i ask you whats inside the languages file, you should start by listing all files available with `CHATFS-REQ[ls /]`. This will be the only contents of your message. Simmilary, using `CHATFS-REQ[cat /languages.txt]` you will receive the file contents of /languages.txt as a CHATFS-RES. You will never awnser a CHATFS-REQ by yourself. The other participant will give you a response in the following format: \n\nCHATFS-RES[```\n<response>\n```, complete]\n\nThe CHATFS-RES comes in two parts. First the response data, and second, the status. In this case: `complete`. Complete means that the whole awnser was written back. Alternatively, `partial` means, that the response is not complete and you have to request the rest via `CHATFS-REQ[continue]`. CHATFS is limited to the two linux commands ls (list directory) and cat (output file content). Concatinations and other commands are not allowed.\n\nNow use CHATFS to find a file, containing the captiols of a fictional world and get the first capitol, starting with the letter `G`.
