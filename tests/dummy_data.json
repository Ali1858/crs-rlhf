I need to power through this and am looking for tips and tricks that have helped others to bring back their motivation.</s><s><|assistant|> 1. Don't power through it. That thinking makes intrinsic motivation less likely. Pretend that you really want to learn the stuff. (Fake it until you make it.)  2. Make a Pomodoro plan. Different tasks require different time slots, so you have to try out different ones for each type.  3. Get off Reddit! (Says someone who is on Reddit when he should be rewriting a manuscript.)</s>"
